## Versioning

We use [SemVer 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) for versioning our releases. Also, we use [Gitflow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/) with [this awesome tool](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) plus [Gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me) to organize our commits/branches.
