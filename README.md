## 📖 About this Project

This project contains the basic structure for our Travel PWA. We're currently using only the website, but we can easily deploy it as a PWΑ on Google Play Store. You may find here all the containers and basic structure required to develop and use our application.

## 🤖 Getting Started

_TODO_

## 🌱 Feature requests

You can see and create feature requests by navigating to the `issues` tab of this repository and filtering by the label `feature-request`(or simply [clicking here](https://github.com/livipdev/pwa-travel/labels/feature-request)). There, you'll find major features that have been requested by our users in a broad scenario. Project-related features are created inside the specific project Github repository. Sometimes you can create a new feature request here and we may move it to a given tool that is the true owner of the context your feature is in, so don't worry if this happens to you.

Also, we've created a simple `feature-request` template, that should be imported as soon as you start a new issue. Please use that to make our triage easier :D

## ⏳ Pending features

Before opening a new feature request, please check out here all the pending features that we're already developing. Those features are not organized in any order, the list is only a place to see if your desired feature is being developed by us.

To view, all issues and feature request that our team is currently developing, go on the [selected-for-development](https://github.com/livipdev/pwa-travel/labels/selected-for-development) tag on our issues tab.

## 🐛 Reporting bugs

You can create new bugs on the `issues` tab (or simply [clicking here](https://github.com/livipdev/pwa-travel/issues)). Don't worry if you aren't sure if your bug relates to this project if there is another tool that is more related to the context behind your issue we're going to move it there.

We've created a template for issues, that contains multiple scenarios that you can use. Please use it to make our triage easier.
